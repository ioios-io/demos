## Demonstrations of [ioios.io](https://ioios.io) Devices
A growing and loosely curated collection of tutorials all written with the aim of showcasing [ioios.io](https://ioios.io) devices whilst providing snippets of useful code for smart home platforms.

## [Home Assistant All-In-One Software](https://github.com/ioios-io/demos/tree/main/Home%20Assistant%20with%20ESPHome) (using ESPHome)
Our software can be found [here](https://github.com/ioios-io/demos/tree/main/Home%20Assistant%20with%20ESPHome) but whilst we have your attention, we'd like to also point you towards a [Custom Menu Generator](https://github.com/mikosoft83/pithy_screen_menu_system) by Milan Korenica (Mikosoft83) which also works very well with [ioios.io devices](https://ioios.io/products).
